echo "=== Test Summary ==="
echo "All tests completed. The scripts now have robust path detection that works in:"
echo "  ✓ Development environments (with BASH_SOURCE)"
echo "  ✓ Release environments (without BASH_SOURCE)"
echo "  ✓ Different working directories"
echo "  ✓ Both Bash and PowerShell environments"

echo "Key improvements:"
echo "  • Fallback detection when BASH_SOURCE is not available"
echo "  • Search for dependencies in common locations (.specify/scripts, scripts/bash, etc.)"
echo "  • Robust execution checks for release environments"
echo "  • Cross-platform compatibility (Bash and PowerShell)"
