# ADR-architect-001: {DECISION_TITLE}

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-09-24T18:11:23Z  
**Phase**: architect  
**Version**: architect.v1.0\_2025-09-24T18:11:23Z

## Context

### Problem Statement

This ADR documents a key architectural decision made during the architect phase of the project. The decision addresses specific architectural challenges and aligns with established patterns from the Knowledge Base.

### Business Context

The business requirements drive the need for a scalable, maintainable, and secure architecture that can support current and future needs while maintaining development velocity.

### Technical Context

Current technical landscape includes existing systems, technology constraints, and integration requirements that influence architectural decisions.

### Knowledge Base Integration

**KB Context**: KB Context: Available  
**KB Reference**: KB Reference: Available  
**Validation Result**: Validation: Completed  
**Applied Patterns**: Clean Architecture, SOLID Principles, Domain-Driven Design

## Decision

### Chosen Solution

The selected architectural approach follows clean architecture principles with clear layer separation and dependency inversion. This solution provides the best balance of maintainability, testability, and scalability.

### Alternative Solutions Considered

#### Alternative 1: Monolithic Architecture

- **Description**: Single deployable unit with all functionality
- **Pros**: Simple deployment, easier debugging, better performance for small scale
- **Cons**: Limited scalability, tight coupling, difficult to maintain at scale
- **KB Compliance**: Partial - violates some clean architecture principles

#### Alternative 2: Microservices Architecture

- **Description**: Distributed system with independent services
- **Pros**: High scalability, technology diversity, independent deployment
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, network overhead, distributed system challenges
- **KB Compliance**: Good - aligns with clean architecture and SOLID principles

### Decision Rationale

The chosen solution provides the optimal balance between complexity and benefits. It follows established architectural patterns from the Knowledge Base while addressing specific project requirements.

### KB Pattern Alignment

This decision aligns with:

- Clean Architecture dependency rule
- SOLID principles, especially Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion
- Domain-Driven Design patterns for business logic organization

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Improved maintainability through clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced testability with dependency inversion
- Better scalability through modular design
- Alignment with industry best practices

### Negative Consequences

- Initial development complexity
- Learning curve for team members
- Additional abstraction layers
- Potential over-engineering for simple features

### Risk Mitigation

- Comprehensive team training on architectural patterns
- Gradual implementation with pilot modules
- Regular architecture reviews and validation
- Documentation of patterns and conventions

### KB Compliance Impact

This decision improves overall KB compliance by:

- Implementing clean architecture principles consistently
- Following established design patterns
- Improving code organization and maintainability

## Implementation

### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Core architecture setup

   - Define layer boundaries
   - Implement dependency injection container
   - Create base abstractions

2. **Phase 2**: Domain implementation

   - Implement domain entities and services
   - Create repository abstractions
   - Implement use cases

3. **Phase 3**: Infrastructure implementation
   - Implement data access layer
   - Add external service integrations
   - Configure dependency injection

### Required Changes

- Restructure existing code to follow layered architecture
- Implement dependency injection throughout the system
- Create abstractions for external dependencies
- Update testing strategy to support new architecture

### Dependencies

- Dependency injection framework selection
- Database abstraction layer implementation
- External service integration patterns
- Testing framework updates

### KB Pattern Implementation

Implementation will follow KB patterns for:

- Clean architecture layer organization
- SOLID principles application
- Dependency injection patterns
- Domain modeling approaches

## Validation

### Acceptance Criteria

- All dependencies flow inward according to clean architecture
- No circular dependencies between layers
- All external dependencies are abstracted
- Unit tests can run without external dependencies

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each layer in isolation
- Integration tests for layer interactions
- Architecture tests to validate dependency rules
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows

### KB Validation Criteria

- Compliance with clean architecture dependency rule
- SOLID principles adherence in all components
- Consistent application of design patterns
- Proper abstraction of external dependencies

## Monitoring

### Success Metrics

- Code quality metrics improvement
- Test coverage increase
- Development velocity maintenance
- Bug rate reduction

### Monitoring Plan

- Regular architecture compliance checks
- Dependency analysis automation
- Code quality metrics tracking
- Team feedback collection

### KB Compliance Monitoring

- Automated validation against KB patterns
- Regular architecture reviews
- Pattern adherence metrics
- Compliance reporting
