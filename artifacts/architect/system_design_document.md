## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture approach with clear separation between:

1. **Presentation Layer**: User interface and API endpoints
2. **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
3. **Domain Layer**: Business logic and domain entities
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access and external integrations

### Architecture Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Components are open for extension, closed for modification
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes are substitutable for base classes

### KB Pattern Application

The architecture applies the following Knowledge Base patterns:

- Clean Architecture dependency rule for proper layer isolation
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Factory pattern for object creation
- Strategy pattern for algorithm variations
