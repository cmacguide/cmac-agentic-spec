## Basic Software Engineering Principles

- Apply SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
- Use clear, descriptive naming for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Write self-documenting code with minimal but effective comments
- Follow consistent code formatting and style guidelines
